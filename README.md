Hi and thank you for considering me for divination services. I'm including this document to cover most of the basic information you may need. I encourage a dialogue so you feel fully comfortable with your decision. Please be aware that I'm an amateur at best.

## Methods & Process

### Oneiromancy

I practice an unsophisticated form of oneiromancy. My dreams often have symbolism that is future telling, or exact visions of the future.

Typically, these dreams are triggered by consuming specific foods. I am working on developing this into a more concrete process.

In order to perform a reading for another person, I need to learn as much as I can about them. I need to feel like we're "old friends catching up." I'll do my absolute best to respect your privacy boundaries, and I'll never require personally identifiable information (eg, full name, address, etc). The more you can share about yourself personally, the more likely this will be to work.

Typically, I ask for one week of preparation to get to know the person I'm performing a reading for. Please be sure to include your timezone and availability. We need to make friends for this to work. If at any point you're not comfortable with me on a personal level, or vise versa, then we need to abort mission.

### Intoxication / Alcohol Based Reading

In the past, I've found that while drinking large quantities of alcohol, I'm able to provide readings at-will. These are typically less exact than my dreams - but are somewhat accurate and appealing as a 'brute force' method.

I do not recommend this type of reading because it's a massive pain in the behind for me; and I'm going to push the cost of doing it onto you.

I'll still need about a week to get to know you. On the evening of the reading, you'll need to be available for about an hour to talk. Ideally, this is when the reading occurs. It'll be more conversational. Voice chat is highly encouraged for these readings. 

## Payment

### Fees

1. Regular Reading - 150L - After successful reading
2. Alcohol Based Reading - 3000L - Up-front

### Payment Policy

I will never charge more than what is necessary for me to complete these readings. I do not do this for profit.

The chance of me having a future-telling dream increases with the consumption of certain foods. Typically, certain crackers, chocolate, coffee, etc. Nothing exuberant. At any time, you may ask for price transparency and I'll obtain my local grocery prices for you (via receipt).

I will only request payment if I have a dream that I'm confident is an exact telling of the future. I will share any symbolism I see with you, but if a dream does not conform to the rules of the reality we live in, I'm not counting it. I cannot guarantee accuracy, but I will guarantee potential.

In other words; 
- If I say that you will win the lottery but you're paid in goats - that won't count. You don't owe me anything. 
- If I'm able to tell you about an upcoming promotion - even if it doesn't actually happen - you owe me.

If I'm unable to provide a reading, I'll allow three, free repeat attempts. These will be scheduled based on availability.

If more than FOUR (4) attempts are required, I'll request a singular payment for the next block of four attempts.

Example;
1. Reading failed - no payment
2. Reading failed - no payment
3. Reading failed - no payment
4. Reading failed - no payment
5. Reading failed - Payment for attempts 5-8 (150L)
6. Reading failed - no payment
7. Reading successful - no payment (covered on payment at attempt 5)
8. N/A - Reading completed

### Alcohol Based Readings

Alcohol based readings are both costly and cumbersome. I greatly prefer NOT to do these. I will not provide any guarantees with them. I will not provide free retries with alcohol based readings.

If you are in an emergency and believe a reading would help, I would suggest this method only because, historically, I've been able to provide somewhat accurate readings AT-WILL while intoxicated. If you want an alcohol based reading, I need to charge up-front, full-cost of alcohol, and again; I cannot guarantee anything. I WOULD NOT recommend this service.

## My History with Divination

Since the age of ~7 I have been having dreams that are;

- Exact depictions of the future
- Depictions of the future with some dream-oddities
- Loose imagery that might be about the future, but probably isn't

The vast majority of these are inconsequential. The dream will foretell what I'm having for lunch in a week or two, a conversation I'll have, or a joke I'll hear. On occasion, my dreams will contain more significant information. This leaves me living in a near constant state of deja vu.

I have also had experiences, usually while intoxicated, where I can tell other people the trajectory of their future. I have less information on this experience.

Up until recent memory (2021~2022), I have considered these dreams to be coincidences or confirmation-bias. Sometime towards the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 maybe?) I had a dream about working at a very specific old job that I hated. I was able to see the staff I was working with, my boss, etc. I told my wife about this dream and we laughed, "Yeah that'll never happen." As a consequence of the vaccine mandates (I am non-vaccinated) I lost my last job ~11/2021 and returned to this aforementioned old job, since they were not impacted by the mandate and at the time, one of the few options I had where I could be employed nearly immediately.

After my wife confirmed my experience, I was convinced in my own ability and developing it further. We are here :)

## About Me

We're going to have to spend a lot of time getting to know each other! But there's some things I want to put out immediately, to confirm we're a decent match and make sure there's nothing here that will spook you;

- I'm a man. I use female avatars for variety and creativity sake, but I am a man. I lift weights, shoot guns, and eat red meat.
- My family is primarily of Irish, Spanish, and German descent (50, 30, 20).
- I was raised in a Catholic family. I hold a soft spot for Catholicism but consider myself agnostic. Most of my personal, moral philosophy is Kantian in nature. Religiously, I have an interest in gnostic schools of thought.
- As previously mentioned, I did not and will not received the COVID-19 vaccine. For some people, this is a hard 'no' - so I share it in advance. Please do not engage if this bothers you.
- I'm also a naturalist/primitivist to some extent or another. I walk around barefoot everywhere, don't bathe enough, eat lots of raw foods, and refuse to take any pharmaceuticals.
- Ironically, I work in the healthcare / life sciences industries as a software engineer.
